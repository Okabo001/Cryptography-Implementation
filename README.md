- Detection of various types of attacks (e.g., DoS, malware)
- Alert generation and logging
- Detailed reporting and visualization

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Scapy library
- ELK Stack (for logging and visualization)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Okabo001/network-ids.git
